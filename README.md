# skonfig museum

The museum (this repository) contains types that either
* used to be included with cdist/skonfig, but are not in use anymore, or
* were submitted to be a part of cdist core/skonfig base, but for some reason did not make it there.

The reasoning is documented in a README file for each type.


### ATTENTION

The types distributed in this repository do not meet the quality requirements
for inclusion in a regular skonfig repository.  These types may only work under
certain circumstances and/or eat your data. **You have been warned!**
